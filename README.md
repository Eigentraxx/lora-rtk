# lora-rtk

Code from [https://github.com/ktrussell/Serial_toLoRa]

Used to send RTCM data from caster to ublox gps chip.
Works with either the Ntrip caster from Lefebure or RTKlib.

Not necessary to modify the smt as noted in the comments.

Only changes made were to the timeouts, lengthed on rx and shortened on tx.

This code works great and saved me a lot of time.
